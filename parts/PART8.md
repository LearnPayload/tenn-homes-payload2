# Part 8 - Contact Form / Property Inquiry

## Contact Form Implementation Summary

Key additions:

- Created contact agent form with validation using React Hook Form and Zod
  schema
- Added server action for form submission with safe-action pattern
- Integrated toast notifications using Sonner for user feedback
- Added form components in /src/forms/property-inquiry/ directory
- Updated dependencies to include React Hook Form, Hookform Resolvers, and
  Sonner

Components created:

- property-inquiry/form.tsx - Contact form component with validation
- property-inquiry/schema.ts - Zod validation schema
- property-inquiry/action.ts - Server action for form processing
- ui/sonner.tsx - Toast notification component

Integration:

- Added Toaster component to layout for global toast notifications
- Form integrated into property detail pages for agent contact functionality

The implementation follows the established patterns in the codebase with proper
validation, error handling, and user feedback mechanisms.

### Model Refactoring (Latest)

- **Removed decorator classes**: Eliminated ContactDecorator and PropertyDecorator classes to simplify architecture
- **Streamlined property data access**: Updated property retrieval in metadata generation and detail pages to use direct model access
- **Model consistency**: Renamed `toJSON` method to `toString` across BaseModel for better consistency

### Complete Lead Management System Implementation

#### New Collections Added

- **Inquiries Collection**: Links contacts to properties with messages for tracking property interest

  - Fields: contact (relationship), property (relationship), message (textarea)
  - Admin list view shows contact, property, and message details

- **Contacts Collection**: Comprehensive CRM-style contact management
  - Core fields: name, email (unique), phone, preferredContact method
  - Status tracking: new, contacted, qualified, active, closed, do-not-contact
  - Agent assignment via assignedTo relationship
  - Buying profile: timeline, budget range, preferred areas, property types
  - Searchable admin interface with sidebar positioning

#### Service Layer Enhancement

- **ContactService**: Added `processLead()` method for complete inquiry handling
  - Finds or creates contacts using email as unique identifier
  - Creates inquiry records linking contacts to properties
  - Automatic agent assignment to contacts

#### Model Architecture

- **Contact Model**: Extends BaseModel with `findOrCreate` method to prevent duplicate contacts
- **Inquiry Model**: Simple model extending BaseModel for inquiry tracking
- **Repository Pattern**: Models exported via centralized index for clean service integration

#### Form Integration

- **Property Inquiry Form**: Complete form workflow with Zod validation
- **Server Actions**: Safe action pattern processing forms via ContactService
- **Toast Notifications**: Real-time user feedback using Sonner
- **Demo Data**: Faker.js integration for realistic test data

The implementation provides a complete lead management workflow: property inquiries automatically create or update contacts, track inquiries, assign agents, and provide full CRM functionality through the Payload admin interface.

### Latest Update - ActiveRecord Pattern Implementation (c792451)

#### Major Architectural Shift
- **ActiveRecord Pattern**: Refactored BaseModel to extend an ActiveRecord-style pattern with built-in query capabilities
- **Enhanced Model Methods**: Models now include static methods like `find()`, `findById()`, `create()`, `update()`, and `delete()` for cleaner data access
- **Simplified Data Retrieval**: Removed complex decorator patterns in favor of direct model method calls

#### Key Changes
- **Property Model**: Streamlined with ActiveRecord methods, improved metadata generation for SEO
- **Contact Model**: Enhanced with ActiveRecord pattern while maintaining `findOrCreate` functionality
- **Base Model**: Complete rewrite to provide ORM-like functionality on top of Payload's data layer
- **Configuration Updates**: Modified server URL handling and environment configuration for better deployment flexibility
- **Form Improvements**: Enhanced property inquiry form with better validation and user experience

#### Files Modified
- 18 files changed with 263 additions and 181 deletions
- Major refactoring of model architecture while maintaining existing functionality
- Improved code organization and developer experience with more intuitive data access patterns

This update significantly improves the codebase's maintainability and provides a more familiar ORM-like interface for data operations.
