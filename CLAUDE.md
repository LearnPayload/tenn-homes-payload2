# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm db:seed` - Seed database with sample data
- `pnpm generate:types` - Generate Payload types
- `pnpm generate:importmap` - Generate import map for Payload admin

## Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js 15 application using Payload CMS 3.33 as a headless CMS with PostgreSQL database. The application follows a dual-layout structure:

### Route Structure
- `(frontend)` - Public-facing real estate marketplace
- `(payload)` - Payload CMS admin interface at `/admin`

### Core Collections
- **Properties** - Main real estate listings with custom ID generation, tabbed admin interface, and URL preview
- **Agents** - Real estate agents managing properties
- **Locations** - Geographic data (cities, states, zip codes)
- **Features** - Property amenities and characteristics
- **Media** - File uploads with pre-configured sizes

### Key Patterns

#### Custom Primary Keys
Uses 8-character generated IDs instead of auto-incrementing integers via `generatePrimaryKey()` function.

#### Repository Pattern
Implements repository pattern in `/src/repositories/` with `BaseRepository` class providing common database operations through Payload client.

#### URL Generation
Properties have custom URL generation using slugified addresses in format: `/home/{state}/{city}/{street-address}/{zip}/home/{id}`

#### Address Formatting
Properties use `formatAddress` hook to automatically generate structured address data from street + location relationship.

### Database Seeding
Comprehensive seeding system in `/src/db/seeders/` with sample data for all collections. Use `pnpm db:seed` to populate development data.

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS 4.1.4 with custom PostCSS configuration
- Frontend styles in `/src/styles/frontend.css`
- Radix UI components in `/src/components/ui/`

### Environment
Requires PostgreSQL database connection via `MONGODB_URI` environment variable (despite name, uses Postgres adapter).
